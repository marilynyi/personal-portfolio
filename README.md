### [Finding Markets for E-Learning Product Promotion](https://github.com/marilynyi/dataquest-data-scientist/blob/main/14_finding_the_best_markets_to_advertise_in/finding_the_best_markets_to_advertise_in.ipynb)

Analyzing the most recent 2021 freeCodeCamp survey data instead of the 2017 one provided by the course, I independently sought to achieve the same project objective as Dataquest's [guided project](https://app.dataquest.io/c/56/m/310/guided-project%3A-finding-the-best-markets-to-advertise-in/1/finding-the-best-two-markets-to-advertise-in?path=2&slug=data-scientist&version=1): identifying the two best markets for an e-learning company to advertise its product in. 

Apart from using only the project objective as my guiding light, this project demonstrates construction of a large set of complex and informative visuals.

### [Investigating New Movie Ratings](https://github.com/marilynyi/dataquest-data-scientist/blob/main/13_investigating_new_movie_ratings/investigating_new_movie_ratings.ipynb)

The original project 'Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings' uses data from 2015 and is very outdated as Fandango no longer uses the rating system the project is based on. This project diverges from the original by exploring ratings for current movie releases in theaters only.

Statistical elements, namely sampling, descriptive statistics (mean), and frequency distributions were incorporated to demonstrate lessons learned in Dataquest: Data Scientist's Part 6: Probability and Statistics leading up to the project. Much of the project also demonstrates web scraping to form our own dataset.

### [Exploring FiveThirtyEight's Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/marilynyi/dataquest-data-scientist/blob/main/09_exploring_star_wars_survey/exploring_fivethirtyeight_star_wars_survey.ipynb)

This is my adaptation and extended version of one of [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/)'s guided projects in which I've analyzed the 1,186 survey responses collected by FiveThirtyEight for their own [original analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/).

### [Instagram Follower Bot](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main/days-51-60/day-52/instagram-follower-bot/)

The Day 52 project of [`/100-days-of-code`](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main) was to create an Instagram bot to automate following any Instagram page's list of followers. 

I followed the advised project structure of using a `class` function with three methods but had to write the solution code independently as the course solution code is very outdated.

### [Automate Giphy GIF Likes](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main/days-41-50/day-50/automate-giphy-gif-likes/)

The Day 50 project of [`/100-days-of-code`](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main) was to create a Tinder bot to automatically match with profiles by liking or disliking. 

I adapted this project by creating a Giphy bot instead to automatically match hashtags of GIFs with the user's search phrase. If they match, the GIF is saved to `Favorites`; otherwise, the GIF is skipped.

[giphy.com](https://giphy.com) was chosen to develop a family-friendly alternative while somewhat preserving the "swipe left or right" functionality of Tinder. 

### [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/marilynyi/dataquest-data-scientist/blob/main/08_analyzing_nyc_high_school_data/analyzing_nyc_high_school_data.ipynb)

This is my adaptation and extended version of one of [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/)'s guided projects in which I've explored the relationships between demographics of New York high school students and its impact on their SAT scores.

### [In-n-Out Burger Calorie Tracker](https://github.com/marilynyi/in-n-out-calorie-tracker)

This is my final project submission to conclude the CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course at HarvardX. The project is a basic calorie tracker specifically for the menu items at In-N-Out Burger.
