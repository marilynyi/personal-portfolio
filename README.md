### [Automate Giphy GIF Likes](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main/days-41-50/day-50/automate-giphy-gif-likes/)

The Day 50 project of [`/100-days-of-code`](https://github.com/marilynyi/100-days-of-code-python/tree/main) was to create a Tinder bot to automatically match with profiles by liking or disliking. 

I adapted this project by creating a Giphy bot instead to automatically match hashtags of GIFs with the user's search phrase. If they match, the GIF is saved to `Favorites`; otherwise, the GIF is skipped.

[giphy.com](https://giphy.com) was chosen to develop a family-friendly alternative while somewhat preserving the "swipe left or right" functionality of Tinder. 


### [In-n-Out Burger Calorie Tracker](https://github.com/marilynyi/in-n-out-calorie-tracker)

This is my final project submission to conclude the CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course at HarvardX. The project is a basic calorie tracker specifically for the menu items at In-N-Out Burger.
